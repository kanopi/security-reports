# Security Report Generator

## SonarQube Report Generator

The following uses the SonarQube API to build an exportable report based on 
the items found within the scan. This works for both a hosted solution 
and a local copy.

### Requirements

Docker is the only tool that is needed for this to run.

### Generating Report

#### Using the Docker Image

Pull the latest docker image

```shell
docker pull devkteam/sonarqube-report:latest
```

Running the docker image can be as simple as running the following:

```shell
docker -it --rm \
  -v $(pwd):/mnt/reports \
  -e SONARQUBE_HOST="https://sonarcloud.io" \
  -e SONARQUBE_USER="user" \
  -e SONARQUBE_PASS="abc" \
  -e SONARQUBE_PROJECTS="project_test" \
  devkteam/sonarqube-report:latest
```

When running the following to pull from Sonarcloud.io a Token will need to be created.

Because some of the APIs are different than the local setup, an organization id is required
for some of the endpoints. That can be passed in via the `SONARQUBE_EXTRA_PARAMS` variable.

```
docker pull devkteam/sonarqube-report:latest
export PROJECTID=<PROJECT_ID>
export SCTOKEN=<TOKEN>
docker run -it --rm \
  -v $(pwd):/mnt/reports \
  -e SONARQUBE_HOST="https://sonarcloud.io" \
  -e SONARQUBE_USER="$SCTOKEN" \
  -e SONARQUBE_PASS="" \
  -e SONARQUBE_PROJECTS="$PROJECTID" \
  -e SONARQUBE_EXTRA_PARAMS='{"global":{"organization":"<ORGANIZATION ID>"}}' \
  devkteam/sonarqube-report:latest
  
```

##### Environment Variables

Environment variables can be used by either exporting them, or by using a `.env` file.

#### Using PHP Source

Clone the source code

```shell
git clone git@github.com:kanopi/security-reports security-reports
cd security-reports
```

Run Composer Install

```shell
composer install
```

Create the `.env` file. Use this to modify any environment variables that should
point to your SonarQube instance.

```shell
cp .env.dist .env
```

Run the `run.php` script

```shell
./run.php
```

### Building From Source

To build the image from source.

```shell
make build
```

### Running full process

Included as part of this is the full process of setting up a local instance of SonarQube and running the scanner on the 
current codebase.

```shell
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kanopi/security-reports/main/run.sh) run
```

## Pantheon Log Report Generator

The following generates a report using GoAccess. The following will generate an HTML report.

### Requirements
